## About the project

> The existence of shells is linked to the very existence of IT.
> 
> At the time, all developers agreed that communicating with a computer using aligned 1/0 switches was seriously irritating.
> 
> It was only logical that they came up with the idea of creating a software to communicate with a computer using interactive lines of commands in a language somewhat close to the human language.
> 
> Thanks to Minishell, you’ll be able to travel through time and come back to problems people faced when Windows didn’t exist.
